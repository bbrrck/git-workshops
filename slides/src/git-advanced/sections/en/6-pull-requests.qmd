# Pull Requests {#pull-requests}

## What is a pull request?

- by creating it, we request the project maintainer to pull our changes and incorporate them into the project
- it can be created within workflows such as feature or forking, but not within the centralized workflow
- it allows developers to discuss the change and perform code reviews

**Examples:**

- [Pybrickz #481](https://dev.azure.com/zna-predictive-analytics/dna-packages/_git/pybrickz/pullrequest/481)
- [Quartodoc #240](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc/pull/240)
- [Quartodoc #288](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc/pull/288)
