## What is Git?

- **version control system** (VCS) or **source control management** (SCM)
- in Slovak: *systém riadenia verzií*
- keeps track of project development history
- useful for teams and for individuals
- not only about code, enables saving arbitrary files (including non-text)

## But... what *really* is Git?

- Git is a **content-addressable** file system
- This means that the **address** of a file (key) is defined by its **content**
- At the core of the Git system is a simple data store that can be accessed using keys
- Key = SHA-1 hash, e.g., `655a20f99af32926cbf6d8fab092506ddd70e49c`

## What does Git store?

Mainly:

- objects
- references (or refs)

## Objects

1. *blob*
    - only content, no metadata (path, name)
2. *tree*
    - a tree contains blobs or other trees
3. *commit*
    - contains pointers to a tree and another commit (parent)
4. *tag*
    - defines an alternative name for another object, which can be used to interact with the object instead of the hash

Each object is identifiable by its SHA-1 hash.

## References = pointers to objects

- A branch is *not* a sequence of commits, but just a pointer to a specific commit

```bash
cat .git/refs/heads/main
# 7c66409021358486e63d2d40c9b07e2c35e8124d

cat .git/refs/remotes/origin/dev
# c29dc332ac3eebebffc5726e16d0e91df170103f

cat .git/refs/tags/v2.6.3
# d49de0ec577052db3e47e2baf5aff0be738637ac
```

**Tip**: In PowerShell, you can use `gc` (alias for `Get-Content`) instead of the `cat` command.
