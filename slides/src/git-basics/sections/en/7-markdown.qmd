# Markdown Crash Course

## What is Markdown?
- **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language (like HTML or TeX) used to create various types of content: documents, articles, slides, web pages, ...
- Markdown is the *de facto* standard for documenting Git projects
- Most Github projects have a `README.md` file that Github automatically renders
- Examples of well-written `README` files: [matiassingers/awesome-readme](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme)

Even these slides were created using Markdown! (with the help of the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) system)
